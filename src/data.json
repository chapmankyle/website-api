        "I was part of a team that was developing a 3D, social website that allowed users to interact with one another in a shared environment. Environments could be created by users and were fully customizable, from the skybox to the audio you heard when walking up to something, which allowed for truly unique experiences that could not be found elsewhere. We used our own implementation of spatial audio that played sounds relative to where you were in the environment, making it feel more like reality.<br /><br />Our main focus was to make it easy for users to attend events and social gatherings from the comfort of their own home, through our 3D website. The platform was designed to host thousands of concurrent users in a single environment at any given moment.<br /><br />Some of my contributions were to solely implement a new chat system (with features such as reactions, threads, groups etc.), rewrite the logic for our editor tools (allowing users more control over how they wanted their environment to look and feel), add multiple third-party integrations (Slack, Teams, Sketchfab, etc.) and update the UX and UI to ensure a smooth and visually-appealing experience.",
